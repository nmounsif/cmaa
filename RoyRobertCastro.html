							<h2>GGM Rob Castro</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Specialty:</span>Shaolin Kenpo</li>
								<li><span>Teaching:</span>Shaolin Kenpo</li>

							</ul>
							<p>Roy Robert Castro, is the oldest son of legendary San Francisco Bay area Martial Arts Pioneer Ralph Castro. He was born the 3rd of 7 children.</p>
							<p>As the oldest Son, Rob was groomed by his father to become successor of the Art of Shaolin Kenpo, his fathers creation, who opened his 1st School in San Francisco in 1958. Rob began his training at the age of 5, getting in line behind his 2 older sisters April and May, who had also began training at respectively 7 and 6 years of age.</p>
							<p>By the age of 8, Rob was performing and competing. One very notable performance was at Family Friend ~Ed Parker's 1964 Longbeach Internationals~, where Rob performed on the same day family friend Bruce Lee made his Grand Debut. Rob's performance is recorded by Bruce Lee Biographer Tom Bleecker as in his book about "Unsettled Matters", of an '8 year old Rob Castro performing an Advanced level Form that brought the crowd to its feet in resounding applause' (Paraphrased, Many thanks to Mr. Bleecker for allowing me to share this excerpt of his work).</p>
							<p>Rob, like most other children, went to school, studied, and had play time. But, going beyond this, he is one of very few American children raised in America who lived Martials Arts from birth. He is now 67 and has been practicing the Art of Shaolin Kenpo for 60 years. He is the Head of the Shaolin Kenpo Family, but as always, shares full credit with his Mother Pat Castro, his Brother 'Boss' Castro, and Sister's April, May, June, July and Mia. Rob Castro is a quiet man, he is very easy to talk to and unpretentious.</p>
							<p>He loves teaching his art, sharing his knowledge and seeing those who come to him walk away with something of value. His official Title is Great Grandmaster, but is also very comfortable being greeted with 'Aloha'.</p>
