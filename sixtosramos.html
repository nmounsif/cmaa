								<p>GGM Sixto Ramos Jr. holds the esteemed position as the lineage holder of the Kajukenbo KenKaBo legacy, a martial art system forged by the renowned Great Grand Master Sid Ascuncion. The rich tapestry of Kajukenbo encompasses five principal branches, each finding its roots in the rich and expansive heritage of this system.
<br>
The Kajukenbo Original Emperado Method, masterminded by Sijo Adriano Emperado, constitutes one of these foundational branches. Alongside it, the Kajukenbo Chuan Fa, shepherded by the venerable GGM Al DeLaCruz, stands as another integral facet. In a parallel vein, the Kajukenbo Wun Hop Kuen Do lineage, guided by the remarkable GGM Al Dacascos, adds to the diverse branches of this martial art. The Kajukenbo Iverson Method, a testament to the innovation of GGM George Iverson, completes this constellation of distinct approaches to Kajukenbo.
<br>
While the Kajukenbo lineage flourishes in various directions, it is the KenKaBo branch that serves as the cradle of their origin. Under the visionary leadership of the indomitable Great Grand Master Sid Ascuncion, KenKaBo has become the nucleus from which these martial art expressions emanate. Through this lineage, the essence of Kajukenbo has been meticulously passed down, enriching each branch with its unique potency and wisdom.
